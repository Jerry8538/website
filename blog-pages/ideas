its so easy to think of things I hate:
- "modern" websites
- how bad ads have gotten
- how nobody respects your choices anymore; you're always selecting "remind me later" instead of "no"
- short-form content
- iss, and how bullshit it is that we're just expected to chatgpt

what about things I like:
- niri, it's so beautiful how it's just a canvas or grid or whatever, and it's such a simple mental model
- dsa labs, (god I'll miss them so much) where it's just you and your editor, 3 hours and 3 questions, and you've just gotta lock in
- recursion, also very pretty
- cycling around a city, best way to explore fr

tbh I just appreciate having control over my computer, because it feels like everyday someone's telling me I should give up control over some part of it to be more productive in the short term
control can be literal control, like with my editor, or it can be over my understanding of what is happening, like with using llms for code

I think people take computers too seriously nowadays
they're just a fun little tool (with unimaginable processing power), and shouldn't really be put into every part of our lives, social media in particular
